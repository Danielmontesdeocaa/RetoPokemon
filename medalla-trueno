        Cook french fries 
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Slice the potatoes 1/2 inch thick. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Soak them cold in water for at least an hour or overnight
        </li>
        <li>
            Rinse them twice with cold water and pat the completely dry
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat oil to 300 degrees
        </li>
        <li>
            Increase heat to 400 degrees
        </li>
        <li>
            Place them on paper towels and sprinkle immediately with salt.
        </li>

            What size to cut the fries: 6 mm / 1/4″ batons is the ideal size for optimum 
            crispiness and fluffy insides. Thicker = less crispy. Thinner = not enough fluffiness 
            inside.

                Keep cut fries in water to prevent them from browning as you continue cutting. 
                No soaking time is actually required. A simple rinse followed by simmering the potatoes 
                in vinegar water takes care of this for us

        <li align="justify">
            Once all the fries are cut, place in a colander then rinse under tap water for 15-20 seconds. 
            This is the first step to remove excess sugars from the surface of the potatoes (more on the
            “why” of this below, but in short its to aid crispiness of course!). Meanwhile, the insides r
            emain untouched by water so they'll cook up nice and fluffy.

                Once the potatoes are rinsed, place them in a pot with cold tap water, vinegar
                 and salt. Bring to a boil on high heat then immediately turn down to low so 
                 the surface is barely rippling. Cook for 10 minutes. See below for the “why” 
                 for this step!

        <li>
            Use a spider or large slotted spoon to remove the potatoes from the water into a 
            colander. Then carefully spread the potatoes out on two tea towel-lined trays to 
            steam dry for 5 minutes. No need to pat them dry, the residual heat will do the job
            for us.

        <li align="justify" style="background-color:burlywood;">
            Cooking vessel Use a heavy-based, large pot that is at least 10 cm / 4″ deep. 
            We need:
            Oil depth 3 cm / 1.2″ of oil (1 litre/quart for the pictured 24cm / 10″ pot). 
            It's barely deep-frying, its more like shallow-frying!
            Safety headroom 7 cm / 2.8″ headroom above the surface of the oil for safety 
            purposes as the oil bubbles up quite a lot when we fry. ⚠️ THIS IS IMPORTANT! Oil 
            overflow is a real risk if you do not do this. It's scary and dangerous, as I found 
            out first hand! Learn from my mistakes.
            Oil temperature Preheat the oil to 205°C/400°F. Use a thermometer to monitor the 
            temperature. I use a Thermapen, see my Essential Kitchenwares post for more details.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            IMPORTANT: For safety reasons, please follow the directions to pause 10 seconds
            between adding batches of more potato into the oil! As you can see in the photos 
            below, the oil bubbles up quite high and vigorously as soon as you add some potato. 
            If you add all the potato in one go, the oil will bubble up even higher and faster, which 
            is risky.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Remove the fries from the oil using a slotted spoon and spread onto a paper towel-lined 
            tray in a single layer. They will be pale and not yet crispy.
            Carry out Fry #1 for the remaining two batches using the same staggered approach 
            (ie. 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3) within each batch. Ensure the oil is back at 205°C/400°F before 
            starting each batch. Then cool all the fries for 30 minutes on some paper towel-lined trays.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            After cooling the fries, heat the oil to 205°C/400°F again. Now fry half all the french 
            fries for 4 minutes until they are a gorgeous golden colour and wonderfully crispy.
            Remove with a slotted spoon into a large paper towel-lined bowl then repeat with the 
            remaining fries.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Now that your fries are done, sprinkle with salt or your favourite fries seasoning 
            while hot so the salt sticks. Toss, then serve! Remember, these fries will stay crispy for
             more than 15 minutes, though of course they are best consumed piping hot!
